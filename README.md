# MCL-Visualizer
Visualize the MCL we made

## Requirements
- Relatively modern Python version
  - Pygame
- GCC C++ Compiler that supports >= C++ 17

## How to run
Run main.py, it'll automatically compile the C++ code

Go to lines 101 and 102 in main.py to change the offset of 
the actual and predicted values and see how they converge 
based off DRIVE_NOISE in localization/constants.hpp
